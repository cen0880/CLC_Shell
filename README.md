# CLC_Shell

This C++ code is designed to simulate equilibria in cholesteric liquid crystals shells, based on the Landau-de Gennes free energy framework, using a 'discrete-then-minimize' strategy.  
The codes here are modified from 1Dimension‘s codes for nematic shell in the following link.  
https://github.com/1Dimension/LC_Defects  
By replacing 1Dimension‘s code in the above link with the files with the same name here, you will get the complete code for calculating the equilibria of cholesteric shells.

Primarily, the code is for the simulations in the following study:
